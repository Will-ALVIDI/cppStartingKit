I encountered few issues updating the package to this state so I apologize if I caused you troubles during this weekend.

You can see the changes just below :

	
	[v] Due to a conflict with the binary operator "~", the destructor highliting was removed.	
	
	[v] Logical operators "!" and "~" now should behave better.
	
	[v] Inheritance accessors now are higlighted.


Have fun !!! ;)
