	Version 0.2.5


CHANGES
-------
	
Due to the requirements of other plugins I renamed CCpp.tmLanguage and CCcc.sublime-settings to C++.tmLanguage and C++.sublime settings.

I duplicated those files and renamed them to C.tmLanguage and C.sublime-settings. 

Inside C.tmLanguage and C++.tmLanguage 1 line was changed, the syntax name, respectively now C and C++.

Now, inside the View > Syntax menu you will find a syntax called C++ Starting Kit with a C and C++ highlighting.

Even if their highligthing are strictly the same I highly recommend you to adapt it to your current language if you want to minimize plugin compatibilty issues. 

If you encounter plugin that need a C++.tmLanguage inside the default syntax folder (SublimeText/Packages), just copy/paste/rename the C++ Starting Kit to C++.tmLanguage inside this folder. 

Have fun !!! ;)
