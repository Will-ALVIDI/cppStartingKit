## Features
* C, C++ and C++11 combined and improved syntax highlighting support.
* Custom C++ build system for g++ compiler.

**It is highly recommended to read the Philosophy section just below and the [Guide](https://github.com/kodLite/cppStartingKit-Guide) before to install and use this package.**

## Philosophy
The main objective of this project is to **provide a complete starting kit and starting point for beginners with C++ and Sublime Text** including :
* A syntax definition which gives you the flexibility to make precise customizations to your syntax highlighting. (see the [Preview](https://github.com/kodLite/cppStartingKit#preview))
* An associated theme which includes all the new scopes. (see [Oasis Theme](https://github.com/kodLite/Oasis-Theme))
* An intelligible build system. (see the [C++ Starting Kit build system](https://github.com/kodLite/cppStartingKit/blob/master/C%2B%2B%20-%20Starting%20Kit.sublime-build))
* A relevant documentation for a quick start and an accessible maintenance.(see [The Guide](https://github.com/kodLite/cppStartingKit-Guide))

**I have to mention two major things before to continue :**

* First, **I'm really new in programming**. The first release of this package is the result of my first week of learning. My original goal is to learn C++ with a lightweight and flexible tool. A tool which allow me to customize my environment and let me control things like compiling.
* The second thing I want to mention is, in my opinion, **this package is not yet ready for production**. Even if the main behaviors are ever described and seem to work correctly, I think it will demand you a certain investment before to make it fully functional for an advanced or professional usage. 

As it is my primary tool for my learning of C++ I will do my best to make it fully functional as soon as possible.
